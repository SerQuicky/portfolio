# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the action will run. Triggers the workflow on push or pull request
# events but only for the main branch
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, pipeline ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main, pipeline ]

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      # Switch to the angular project
      - name: Switch to angular
        working-directory: ./angular-portfolio

      - name: Install npm dependencies
        run: npm install

      # Build angular dist
      #- name: Build dist
      #  run: ng build --prod --base-href ./
